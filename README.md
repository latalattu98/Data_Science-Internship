# Data Science


Data science is an interdisciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms and systems to 
extract knowledge and insights from noisy, structured and unstructured data, and apply knowledge and actionable 
insights from data across a broad range of application domains. Data science is related to data mining, 
machine learning and big data.
 
Data science is a "concept to unify statistics, data analysis, informatics, and their related methods" in order to
"understand and analyze actual phenomena" with data.[3] It uses techniques and theories drawn from many fields within the 
context of mathematics, statistics, computer science, information science, and domain knowledge. However, 
data science is different from computer science and information science. Turing Award winner Jim Gray imagined 
data science as a "fourth paradigm" of science (empirical, theoretical, computational, and now data-driven) and 
asserted that "everything about science is changing because of the impact of information technology" and the data deluge.

## Colaboratory

It's a Awesome platform to improving a python coding.
    
Colab is ideal for everything from improving your Python coding skills to working with deep learning libraries,
    like PyTorch, Keras, TensorFlow, and OpenCV. You can create notebooks in Colab, upload notebooks, store notebooks,
    share notebooks, mount your Google Drive and use whatever you’ve got stored in there, import most of your 
    favorite directories, upload your personal Jupyter Notebooks, upload notebooks directly from GitHub,
    upload Kaggle files, download your notebooks, and do just about everything else that 
    you might want to be able to Working in Google Colab for the first time has been totally phenomenal
    and pretty shockingly easy, but it hasn’t been without a couple of small challenges! 
    If you know Jupyter Notebooks at all, you’re pretty much good to go in Google Colab, 
    but there are just a few little differences that can make the difference between flying off to
    freedom on the wings of free GPU and sitting at our computer.

## Learning

 i learnt how to create Github Repository,  what is use of google colaboratory in python Data Science. 
 i started with Basics of Python like printing Statements, Variables, function, conditional statements.
 I had learnt in the internship. I have got an clear idea about the Data Science and 
 how to used python code in Data Sets, Nampy’s, Pandas, Visualization etc,  and 
 i learnt how to divide the datas from csv and tsv files. I had Solved 4-5 csv files 
 based on Data sets like car data, fish data etc and i had divided based on particular rows and columns.
